RedLink is a modern, user-friendly blood donation and management platform designed to connect blood donors, recipients, and hospitals more efficiently. The project aims to solve a very real problem: during emergencies, people struggle to find the right blood donor on time. RedLink makes the entire process faster, smoother, and more accessible.

“If technology can bring help to someone in need even a few minutes earlier, it is worth building.”

The platform makes the blood donation ecosystem more transparent, organized, and human-friendly. Whether it's a donor willing to help, a patient searching for hope, or an admin team trying to keep everything running smoothly—RedLink connects them all.
